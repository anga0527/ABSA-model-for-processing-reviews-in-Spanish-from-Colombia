# ABSA-model-for-processing-reviews-in-Spanish-from-Colombia
Sentiment analysis project based on aspects and polarities (ABSA) applied to reviews of mobile applications in Colombian Spanish, using natural language processing and machine learning techniques, and integrating a web prototype for the visualization of results.

## Objective
To develop and evaluate an aspect- and polarity-based sentiment analysis model capable of identifying user opinions in mobile app reviews, considering the linguistic and contextual characteristics of Colombian Spanish.

---

## Methodology
The project is structured into four main phases:

1. **Corpus collection and construction**  
   Extraction of reviews from Google Play, linguistic preprocessing, and creation of a manually labeled evaluation dataset.

2. **ABSA model implementation**  
   Evaluation and selection of NLP and Machine Learning techniques, including both classical models and transformer-based approaches.

3. **Model evaluation**  
   Performance assessment using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score on a validation dataset.

4. **Web prototype development**  
   Integration of the trained model into a web environment for data input and sentiment analysis visualization.
